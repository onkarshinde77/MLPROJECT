```



# Other Information : 
### In a machine learning (ML) project, a setup.py file is used primarily to package and distribute your project as a Python package. This file contains metadata about your project—such as its name, version, author, dependencies (required libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn), and other configuration details—to enable easy installation and reuse
